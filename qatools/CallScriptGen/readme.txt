CallScriptGen will create call scripts for use with SimClient.  You still need to set 
some configuration parameters in SimClient, select use call script, and import the script 
generated by this tool.

The browse feature may be broken in SimClient.  If it is, paste the full path in SimClient.

Use CallScriptDriver.cmd file to and drive the test.  Copy and customize that file for your
call script.  Don't customize CallScriptGen.cmd with your values and check them in.  Not all 
parameters in CallScriptGen are supported at this time.  I will be adding support for features 
as they are needed by me or anyone who lets me know what they want.

To change the call script, change the value of variables in CallScriptDriver

Run CreateCallScript -h to see what the actual parameters are. 

NOTE:  I need this right now so this is not pretty but it does work.

NOTE2: For some crazy reason the first line of the script has a leading space or unrecognizable 
character that needs to be removed before using the script.
