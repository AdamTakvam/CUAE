Outstanding Issues / Questions / Todo
-------------------------------------

1.  ARE.ScriptLogic.Forward: 
    When a forward occurs, does the script which forwarded end?
    If it does end, are there any conflicts created next time that instance is used?
    
    
2.  OAM UpdateConfig does not take affect very fast. Currently, I set a 2 second wait after calling it for safety's sake.
   

Undealt-with exceptions
-----------------------

1.  Error: Application: Error creating action GUID for action: 1 with routing GUID:

Action not processed

This exception appeared after an exiting application received an event: which, though processing a 
Exit, still accepted the event.


2.  Invalid Regex causes unhandled exception, and subsequent scripts can not be triggered.
(for example, use '*')




Media Server Issues

1.  Scenario: Playing to a conference.  Recording on a connection in that conference.  An attempt to mute that connection returns 14 (connection busy). 







Max Bugs
-----------------------------
1.  When a package has a new action, it will not show up in its tab, even though when one goes to add/remove items, it shows it as checked, 
indicating that it is present.  The action will show up, however, if one unchecks/applies, then checks/applies.
