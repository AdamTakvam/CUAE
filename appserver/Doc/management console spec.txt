===============================================================================================

============
1.0 OVERVIEW
============

The Metreos Management Console will serve as the primary interface for managing the Metreos 
platform. Authorized users will have the power to install providers, applications, and tweak
configuration values. They will be able to review system status and troubleshoot problems. 
The scope of these capabilities will include control over the Metreos Media Server, the Metreos 
Application Server (Samoa), any installed providers and applications, as well as application
instances.

The implementation of the Metreos Management Console will be done through a web-based interface
using a series of web forms. This implementation will be completed using Microsoft Internet
Information Services and ASP.NET.

====================
2.0 USERS AND ACCESS
====================

The configuration database for Samoa permits a variety of users with varying permissions. The 
Management Console mirrors this capability by allowing a user to login using secure credentials
and then access only the corresponding configuration settings and interface options provided for 
that user. 

========================
3.0 CONSOLE ARCHITECTURE
========================

The Management Console will be divided into the following sections:

  Entry Page - This is the first section all users see when they invoke the Management Console.
  This page challenges them to enter an appropriate username and password to enter the system.
 
  Main Status Page - This section serves as a homepage for users of the Management Console. It 
  provides statistics regarding the current status of the Application Server and Media Server
  and provides links to the subsequent sections
 
  User Management - Interface for managing users and user permissions, and changing passwords.
  This section may be only partially implemented, since the Administrator account is sufficient 
  for controlling the system, and only the ability to change one's own password is strictly 
  necessary.

  Application Server Management - Section for modifying configuration values and performing actions
  on Samoa. This includes installing and removing providers and applications.

  Media Server Management - Section for configuring and maintaining the Media server. Note: It is
  not known what services the Media server provides for remote management or configuration.

3.1 Entry Page

The entry page will contain the requisite username and password form, with supporting text 
explaining the purpose of this entry form. The layout and physical design of the entry page 
will set the standard for the remainder of the interface.

3.2 Main Status Page

The main status page will contain some basic statistics about the status of the Application Server 
and the Media Console. (Note: Future versions could potentailly include activity graphs and 
more complex, time-based statistics.) A subsection within this page will permit users to stop and
restart the entire Metreos platform. Links will lead to Application Server and Media Server 
management respectively, as well as the User Management feature.

3.3 User Management

This section provides several distinct features for handling user: changing ones own password, 
creating and deleting new users, and changing the permissions for existing users. Permissions
include access to individual configuration settings as well as the providers and applications 
themsevelves.

3.4 Application Server Management

This feature provides all the application server access defined for this user in the User 
Management section. This includes the ability to install, start, stop and uninstall applications,
to kill active instances of applications, and to install and uninstall providers. Additionally
the user may access any and all configuration settings for which they have the appropdiate 
permissions.


3.5 Media Server Management

NOTE: It is not known what level of remote configuration and control of the Media server is
available. Thus, the capabilities of this section are not yet defined.

======================
4.0 DESIGN REQUIRMENTS
======================

4.1 Standards-Based Implementation

The system will be implemented using XHTML 1.0 (strict) and CSS 2.0. 

4.2 Accessibility

The site will meet the W3C Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 
(See: http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html)

4.3 Usability

The site will be tested and revised using a small group of users through a traditional 
usability test.

4.4 Branding

The site will make heavy use of the Metreos logo and taglines.
