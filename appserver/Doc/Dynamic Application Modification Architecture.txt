[Logical Flow]

General:

- The Session Manager creates a file system watcher for the configured application XML directory.

- A management interface creates/changes/deletes a file in the configured application XML directory.

- The watcher fires an event (created/changed/deleted) on Session Manager.

Create:

- The Create operation occurs as specified in "Action-Event Routing Architecture: Initialization".

Change:

- The event handler does a search by value to locate the DomainInfo associated with this file name.

- The Session Manager calls SetAppData() on AppLoader with the name of the file that was modified.

- AppLoader reassembles the file and copies the new ApplicationData object into all non-running apps.

- AppLoader also stores a reference to the ApplicationData locally.

- AppLoader sets the dirty flag on all running apps.

- When StopApp is called, the new ApplicationData is put into the app which was running.

Delete:

- The event handler does a search by value to locate the DomainInfo associated with this file name.

- The AppLoader sends a message to ED to remove triggering info for the app with this ID

- The Session Manager calls SetAppData(null) on AppLoader.

- AppLoader sets ApplicationData to null on all non-running apps.

- AppLoader fails on all future StartApp requests.

- AppLoader sets the local ApplicationData reference to null.

- AppLoader sets the dirty flag on all running Apps. If there are no running apps, ClearAppData returns true, otherwise false.

- AppLoader maintains a count of running apps

- When StopApp is called, the ApplicationData reference is set to null on the app which was running.

- AppLoader decrements the running app count and returns it in the StopApp method call.

- When the number of running apps is zero, Session Manager unloads the domain.

- Session Manager removes entry from appDomains hash.
