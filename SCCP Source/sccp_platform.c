 *   If not, I'll be glad to provide one.
 *
 * FEATURES
 * - careful adherence to specs regarding flags, field width and precision;
 * - good performance for large string handling (large format, large
 *   argument or large paddings). Performance is similar to system's sprintf
 *   and in several cases significantly better (make sure you compile with
 *   optimizations turned on, tell the compiler the code is strict ANSI
 *   if necessary to give it more freedom for optimizations);
 * - return value semantics per ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("ISO C99");
 * - written in standard ISO/ANSI C - requires an ANSI C compiler.
 *
 * SUPPORTED CONVERSION SPECIFIERS AND DATA TYPES
 *
 * This snprintf only supports the following conversion specifiers:
 * s, c, d, u, o, x, X, p  (and synonyms: i, D, U, O - see below)
 * with flags: '-', '+', ' ', '0' and '#'.
 * An asterisk is supported for field width as well as precision.
 *
 * Length modifiers 'h' (short int), 'l' (long int),
 * and 'll' (long long int) are supported.
 * NOTE:
 *   If macro SNPRINTF_LONGLONG_SUPPORT is not defined (default) the
 *   length modifier 'll' is recognized but treated the same as 'l',
 *   which may cause argument value truncation! Defining
 *   SNPRINTF_LONGLONG_SUPPORT requires that your system's sprintf also
 *   handles length modifier 'll'.  long long int is a language extension
 *   which may not be portable.
 *
 * Conversion of numeric data (conversion specifiers d, u, o, x, X, p)
 * with length modifiers (none or h, l, ll) is left to the system routine
 * sprintf, but all handling of flags, field width and precision as well as
 * c and s conversions is done very carefully by this portable routine.
 * If a string precision (truncation) is specified (e.g. %.8s) it is
 * guaranteed the string beyond the specified precision will not be referenced.
 *
 * Length modifiers h, l and ll are ignored for c and s conversions (data
 * types wint_t and wchar_t are not supported).
 *
 * The following common synonyms for conversion characters are supported:
 *   - i is a synonym for d
 *   - D is a synonym for ld, explicit length modifiers are ignored
 *   - U is a synonym for lu, explicit length modifiers are ignored
 *   - O is a synonym for lo, explicit length modifiers are ignored
 * The D, O and U conversion characters are nonstandard, they are supported
 * for backward compatibility only, and should not be used for new code.
 *
 * The following is specifically NOT supported:
 *   - flag ' (thousands' grouping character) is recognized but ignored
 *   - numeric conversion specifiers: f, e, E, g, G and synonym F,
 *     as well as the new a and A conversion specifiers
 *   - length modifier 'L' (long double) and 'q' (quad - use 'll' instead)
 *   - wide character/string conversions: lc, ls, and nonstandard
 *     synonyms C and S
 *   - writeback of converted string length: conversion character n
 *   - the n$ specification for direct reference to n-th argument
 *   - locales
 *
 * It is permitted for str_m to be zero, and it is permitted to specify NULL
 * pointer for resulting string argument if str_m is zero (as per ISO C99).
 *
 * The return value is the number of characters which would be generated
 * for the given input, excluding the trailing null. If this value
 * is greater or equal to str_m, not all characters from the result
 * have been stored in str, output bytes beyond the (str_m-1) -th character
 * are discarded. If str_m is greater than zero it is guaranteed
 * the resulting string will be null-terminated.
 *
 * NOTE that this matches the ISO C99, OpenBSD, and GNU C library 2.1,
 * but is different from some older and vendor implementations,
 * and is also different from XPG, XSH5, SUSv2 specifications.
 * For historical discussion on changes in the semantics and standards
 * of snprintf see printf(3) man page in the Linux programmers manual.
 *
 * Routines asprintf and vasprintf return a pointer (in the ptr argument)
 * to a buffer sufficiently large to hold the resulting string. This pointer
 * should be passed to free(3) to release the allocated storage when it is
 * no longer needed. If sufficient space cannot be allocated, these functions
 * will return -1 and set ptr to be a NULL pointer. These two routines are a
 * GNU C library extensions (glibc).
 *
 * Routines asnprintf and vasnprintf are similar to asprintf and vasprintf,
 * yet, like snprintf and vsnprintf counterparts, will write at most str_m-1
 * characters into the allocated output string, the last character in the
 * allocated buffer then gets the terminating null. If the formatted string
 * length (the return value) is greater than or equal to the str_m argument,
 * the resulting string was truncated and some of the formatted characters
 * were discarded. These routines present a handy way to limit the amount
 * of allocated memory to some sane value.

 *
 * REVISION HISTORY
 * 1999-04	V0.9  Mark Martinec
 *		- initial version, some modifications after comparing printf
 *		  man pages for Digital Unix 4.0, Solaris 2.6 and HPUX 10,
 *		  and checking how Perl handles sprintf (differently!);
 * 1999-04-09	V1.0  Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>
 *		- added main test program, fixed remaining inconsistencies,
 *		  added optional (long long int) support;
 * 1999-04-12	V1.1  Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>
 *		- support the 'p' conversion (pointer to void);
 *		- if a string precision is specified
 *		  make sure the string beyond the specified precision
 *		  will not be referenced (e.g. by strlen);
 * 1999-04-13	V1.2  Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>
 *		- support synonyms %D=%ld, %U=%lu, %O=%lo;
 *		- speed up the case of long format string with few conversions;
 * 1999-06-30	V1.3  Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>
 *		- fixed runaway loop (eventually crashing when str_l wraps
 *		  beyond 2^31) while copying format string without
 *		  conversion specifiers to a buffer that is too short
 *		  (thanks to Edwin Young <edwiny@autonomy.com> for
 *		  spotting the problem);
 *		- added macros PORTABLE_SNPRINTF_VERSION_(MAJOR|MINOR)
 *		  to snprintf.h
 * 2000-02-14	V2.0 (never released) Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>
 *		- relaxed license terms: The Artistic License now applies.
 *		  You may still apply the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 *		  as was distributed with previous versions, if you prefer;
 *		- changed REVISION HISTORY dates to use ISO 8601 date format;
 *		- added vsnprintf (patch also independently proposed by
 *		  Caolan McNamara 2000-05-04, and Keith M Willenson 2000-06-01)
 * 2000-06-27	V2.1  Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>
 *		- removed POSIX check for str_m<1; value 0 for str_m is
 *		  allowed by ISO C99 (and GNU C library 2.1) - (pointed out
 *		  on 2000-05-04 by Caolan McNamara, caolan@ csn dot ul dot ie).
 *		  Besides relaxed license this change in standards adherence
 *		  is the main reason to bump up the major version number;
 *		- added nonstandard routines asnprintf, vasnprintf, asprintf,
 *		  vasprintf that dynamically allocate storage for the
 *		  resulting string; these routines are not compiled by default,
 *		  see comments where NEED_V?ASN?PRINTF macros are defined;
 *		- autoconf contributed by Caolan McNamara
 * 2000-10-06	V2.2  Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>
 *		- BUG FIX: the %c conversion used a temporary variable
 *		  that was no longer in scope when referenced,
 *		  possibly causing incorrect resulting character;
 *		- BUG FIX: make precision and minimal field width unsigned
 *		  to handle huge values (2^31 <= n < 2^32) correctly;
 *		  also be more careful in the use of signed/unsigned/size_t
 *		  internal variables - probably more careful than many
 *		  vendor implementations, but there may still be a case
 *		  where huge values of str_m, precision or minimal field
 *		  could cause incorrect behaviour;
 *		- use separate variables for signed/unsigned arguments,
 *		  and for short/int, long, and long long argument lengths
 *		  to avoid possible incompatibilities on certain
 *		  computer architectures. Also use separate variable
 *		  arg_sign to hold sign of a numeric argument,
 *		  to make code more transparent;
 *		- some fiddling with zero padding and "0x" to make it
 *		  Linux compatible;
 *		- systematically use macros fast_memcpy and fast_memset
 *		  instead of case-by-case hand optimization; determine some
 *		  breakeven string lengths for different architectures;
 *		- terminology change: 'format' -> 'conversion specifier',
 *		  'C9x' -> 'ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("ISO C99")',
 *		  'alternative form' -> 'alternate form',
 *		  'data type modifier' -> 'length modifier';
 *		- several comments rephrased and new ones added;
 *		- make compiler not complain about 'credits' defined but
 *		  not used;

 * NEED_V?ASN?PRINTF macros automatically turns off NEED_SNPRINTF_ONLY
 * and turns on PREFER_PORTABLE_SNPRINTF.
 *
 * Watch for name conflicts with the system library if these routines
 * are already present there.
 *
 * NOTE: vasprintf and vasnprintf routines need va_copy() from stdarg.h, as

 * I don't know of any other standard and portable way of achieving the same.
 * With some versions of gcc you may use __va_copy(). You might even get away

 *
 * - For portable applications it is best not to rely on peculiarities

 *
 * - Selecting compatibility with more than one operating system
