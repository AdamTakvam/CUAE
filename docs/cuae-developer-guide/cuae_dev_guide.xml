      <title>About this Book</title>

      <para>This book is about the Cisco Unified Application Environment
      (CUAE) and how to use it to build applications that leverage the Cisco
      Unified Communications System platform. Cisco's Unified Communications
      System platform is deployed in over 40,000 businesses and is the market
      leading voice, video, and data communications platform available on the
      market today. This book will teach you how to create software
      applications for the communications market and how to enhance existing
      software by embedding communications capabilities. The material in this
      book will cover, from the ground up, the CUAE language, how to apply it
      to practical problems, how to extend it by building plug-ins, and how to
      integrate it with other popular programming languages and
      frameworks.</para>

      <title>Why Read this Book?</title>

      <para>Software developers interested in building communications
      applications or adding these capabilities to an existing application
      will find this book particularly interesting.</para>

      <formalpara>
        <title>It's a new and important skill to have.</title>

        <para>Voice over IP has made telephony and video a much more
        accessible technology to developers. The consumer and business IP
        telephony markets have grown tremendously over the last ten years and
        it is no longer a technology that can be ignored by developers. It is
        important for you to understand the technology and how to build
        applications that use unified communications.</para>

        <title>The technology is really neat.</title>

      <title>Using this Book</title>

      <para>This book is intended to give novice and expert software
      developers an understanding of all tools and techniques required to be
      successful developing applications using the Cisco Unified Applications
      Environment. It is split into four main parts. The first part, CUAE
      Programming Fundamentals, is intended to be read first and completed
      sequentially. The remaining three parts of the book can be tackled
      piecemeal and in whichever order the reader finds most suitable for
      their experience level and goals.<itemizedlist>

            Programming Fundamentals</link></para>

            <para>This part introduces the CUAE Software Development Kit
            (SDK), core language concepts, a detailed explanation of the CUAE
            application execution model, debugging strategies, and other tools
            and techniques that can be used when building applications using
            the CUAE. Additionally, a thorough explanation of the Cisco
            Unified Visual Designer and how to use its graphical programming
            model is presented.</para>

            <para><link linkend="pt_practical_application">Practical
            Application of the CUAE</link></para>

            <para>This portion of the book explores how to apply the CUAE and
            its capabilities to various areas of unified communications.
            Covered in detail are how to build call control applications, how
            to leverage the media processing capabilities of the system,
            consuming web services, leveraging the HTTP capabilities of CUAE,
            building IP phone services, leveraging the AVVID XML Layer
            (AXL-SOAP) for programmatic configuration of CUCM, and much
            more.</para>

            <para><link linkend="pt_cuae_plugins">Building Plug-ins to Extend
            the CUAE</link></para>

            <para>The CUAE is built around a very robust extensibility model.
            Multiple plug-in layers enable developers to extend the
            capabilities of the Application Server and leverage those
            extensions within the Visual Designer. Chapters within this
            portion of the book explore how to build each of the differing
            types of plug-ins, installing those plug-ins, and using them from
            within the Visual Designer.</para>
          </listitem>

            <para><link linkend="pt_cuae_and_friends">Integrating CUAE
            Applications with Friends</link></para>

            <para>Often times CUAE applications must interact with services or
            applications built in other languages and runtime environments
            such as J2EE and web services. This part of the book describes
            effective strategies for integrating with other applications built
            using other technologies.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>Appendices are provided that cover various primer material for
      developers who do not have exposure to telephony or other tangential
      technologies that the CUAE leverages extensively. It is recommended that
      you read those applicable appendices before progressing through the book
      if you are not familiar with the relevant foundation material. Finally,
      all examples in this book (including this book itself) are included as
      part of the CUAE SDK package to make it easier for you to load, build,
      and run examples as you encounter them.</para>
