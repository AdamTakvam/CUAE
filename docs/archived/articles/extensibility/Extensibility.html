	<p>
		It is possible to directly extend the CUAE with .NET via 3 extension types:
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Providers</li><li>Native Actions</li><li>Native Types</li></ul></div>
		Providers allow developers to create actions and events, while Native Actions only allow one to build actions.  
		Native Types allow developers to create new variable types for use in their project.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In practice, the reason one wants to extend the CUAE is to provide a new hook for applications to communicate with an API.
		The question of 'Can I integrate the CUAE into a particular API of interest' has a fairly simple answer:  if you can 
		use .NET to communicate with the API, then yes you can.  Choosing the right type of plug-in for a given integration is a separate
		issue discussed in another article.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		There is are a few exceptions to this rule, however.  All of them relate APIs or features already provided by the CUAE.  This is
		discussed in the next section.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are certain features, and even some classes of plug-ins, that are not extendable today in the CUAE.  In general, these are:
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Call Control APIs</li><li>Media Engine</li><li>Custom Alarms</li></ul></div>
	</p>
	<p>
		Call Control Providers today are only implementable by the CUAE development team.  This is because their are certain internal components within
		the routing mechanism of the Application Server that are aware of the Call Control Providers and treat them specially.  The reason
		this extra, non-extensible layer exists for the Call Control Providers is to make it possible to use the Cisco CallControl API 
		without specifying the particular telephony protocol at development-time.  This level of abstraction above SIP, H.323, CTI, and SCCP
		is not trivial and was not designed to be extensible.  Also, Call Control Providers also have hooks into the Call Route Group feature, 
		which is also not extensible.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Media Engine is controlled tightly by the Media Control Provider.  The only way to control the Media Engine is through the MediaControl
		API.  Media Engine behavior can not be extended.  For instance, if you want to create an RTP stream from the Media Engine to an endpoint within
		your own provider, you will have to send an event to an application which does a CreateConnection method on behalf of the provider to the media endpoint.
	</p>
	<p>
		The ability to send alarms via SNMP and SMTP are not available to extensions.  At best, as a matter of convention one could use the
		Send email action in each application built to add real-time administrative error reporting.

	<p>
		Non .NET Services are possible, but there is not a well-defined framework with which to integrate non .NET code into the CUAE.  For instance, it is technically
		feasible to install a Java-based service on the CUAE, but to be useful to the Application Server, one would also have to build a provider
		which communicates with that Java service, with the ultimate goal of piping actions and events into applications to and from the Java code.
