Joel, Here is a list of the open source software and a snippet from the license.  I have also attached the full license to this email.  This list corresponds to the open source software that our software uses in source code or binary code form.

 

James, please review the list below and let me know if I have missed anything. I generated the list based on what is in Contrib.  I suspect there may some things in the firmware that aren’t on this list below.

Oracle is now requesting disclosure of open source code.

 

I know we completed a full list of other code in our product but I cannot find it – do you have a copy?

 

Can you send it to me asap?
