(( 2 ))	Installing SpeechWorks OpenSpeech Recognizer 3.0


OpenSpeech Recognizer 3.0 comes with an automated installation program. 
Follow these steps (described below) to ensure a proper installation. 

1. OSR 3.0 requires third-party software in order to function.  Before 
   installing OSR 3.0, verify that the target system meets the third-party 
   software requirements listed in section 1, and perform upgrades
   where necessary.
2. Before installing OSR 3.0, verify that the target system meets the 
   hardware requirements listed in section 1, and perform upgrades
   where necessary.
3. Install OSR 3.0 from the FTP download.
4. Configure your system.

In order to complete these steps successfully, you must be logged on to 
your Windows system as an Administrator, or your Linux system as root.  The
next sections describe each of these steps.

Once you have verified that your hardware meets the minimum requirements 
listed above and have performed required third party software installations 
or upgrades, you may install OpenSpeech Recognizer from the OpenSpeech 
Recognizer 3.0 installation files. 

A. Installing/Uninstalling OpenSpeech Recognizer 3.0 for Windows
================================================================

With OpenSpeech Recognizer 3.0, the installation process makes it simple to 
install the OpenSpeech Recognizer run-time engine, language packs, and/or
grammar converters.

NEW INSTALLATIONS
-----------------

1. Installing the core recognizer software

- Download OpenSpeech Recognizer 3.0 from www.scansoft.com.
- Log into Windows with an account having Administrator privileges.
- Double-click on the setup.exe application to begin the install.
- Follow the on-screen instructions, reading the Welcome screen and the 
  Software License Agreement.
- Choose one or more components to install, using the displayed information 
  to make sure you have sufficient disk space:

  Installation Option		  Description
  -------------------		  -----------
  OpenSpeech Recognizer           Speech recognition run-time engine, SDK, and 
                                  documentation

  (sub-component) Server Support  Installs all of the necessary files, services, and
				  registry variables to run OSR in server mode.
				  You must select "OpenSpeech Recognizer" to
				  use this subcomponent.  With this configuration,
				  an OSR client is required in order to connect to it.

  Grammar Translators             Translators for various grammar formats into
                                  the XML format that is supported by the
                                  OpenSpeech Recognizer at run-time.

  3rd Party Licensing Components  Small-footprint daemons required to provide
				  OSR 3.0 with run-time licenses.  If you
				  unselect this component, you will have to
				  install a FLEXlm license server manually,
				  as well as install the SpeechWorks vendor
				  daemon separately.  OSR 3.0 will NOT operate
				  without licenses, so SpeechWorks does not
				  recommend unselecting this component at any
				  time.  There is detailed information about
				  licensing in the OSR 3.0 Licensing Handbook.

  OpenSpeech Recognizer Client    Speech recognition client engine and documentation.
				  Specify just this if you want the machine to be 
				  client only.

- Choose a target directory for the OSR 3.0 software.
  The default is "C:\Program Files\SpeechWorks\OpenSpeech Recognizer"

2. Installing a language pack

- Download an OpenSpeech Recognizer 3.0 Language Pack from www.scansoft.com.
- Log into Windows with an account having Administrator privileges.
- Double-click on the setup.exe application to begin the install.
- Follow the on-screen instructions, reading the Welcome screen and the 
  Software License Agreement.
- The language pack data files will be installed to the target directory used for
  the core recognizer install.

REMOVAL/MAINTENANCE INSTALLATIONS
---------------------------------
If your system already contains a version of OSR 3.0 or an OSR 3.0 Language Pack
(note, this is *not* the same thing as an upgrade from OSR 1.0), do the following.

- Log into Windows with an account having Administrator privileges.
- Double-click on the setup.exe application to begin the install.
- Follow the on-screen instructions, reading the Welcome screen and the 
  Software License Agreement.

  ------------------		  -----------
  Modify (core install only)	  Add components or remove installed components 
				  (see the section immediately above)

  Repair			  Restore missing files and replace changed
				  files with their defaults from the install package

  Remove			  Uninstall OSR 3.0 or a language pack completely.
				  ***This may not remove local grammar/inet 
				  cache directories, log files, or your own 
				  files. You will need to remove these files 
				  manually.

SILENT INSTALLATIONS
--------------------
It is possible to install from the command line.  When doing so, NO dialogs
will be presented; uninstallations will proceed without confirmation,
new installs will use all default components, etc.

     rm -rf /usr/local/SpeechWorks/OpenSpeech_Recognizer_Client

  2. Clean the environment:
     a. Delete SWISRSDK variable
     b. Remove the $SWISRSDK/bin from PATH
     c. Remove the $SWISRSDK/lib from LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


(( 3 ))	Configuring the OpenSpeech Recognizer 3.0 Environment


A. Windows
==========

- Open the SpeechWorks.cfg text configuration file for editing.  This
  file is located in your installation directory.

  ** Alternatively, you can use environment variables.  Environment variables
     will override settings in SpeechWorks.cfg!!!!

- Set and modify the following values:

  SWIlicenseServerList:
	  Replace "27000@localhost" with the actual location of your license
	  server.  If it's to run on your install machine, no change is
	  needed, unless you wish to add other servers.  See the "OSR 3.0
          Licensing Handbook" for instructions on how to change this, or add
          more servers.

  SWIsvcMonAutoStart:
	  Set to yes (this instructs the SWIsvcMonitor service to automatically
	  start the OSRServer when the windows service is started).

- If you installed the client software on this machine, you must configure the available
  OSR Servers in the SWIsvrConfig.xml file. Please consult the OSR Client/Server Operator's Guide.

- If you are running the OSR Server software, you must run both the SWIsvcMonitor and the OSRServer.
  Restart the "SpeechWorks OSR CS Server" service and execute "swisvc -start" from the command line.

- Windows XP Service Pack 2
 
  Windows XP Service Pack 2 contains a new feature introduced by Microsoft, called the
  Windows Security Center.  This is not an optional component; it will be automatically
  installed with Service Pack 2.  Some consideration for the Security Center components
  must be made when configuring OSR.  The Security Center has three components:

   1. Windows Firewall
   2. Automatic Updates
   3. Virus Protection

   A note about Security Center shield colors
   ------------------------------------------
   Not all Security Center tools impact a typical user of OSR.  Microsoft ships Windows XP 
   SP2 with all settings set to optimal  this turns the respective shield icons in the 
   Security Center green.  For the shield to remain green:
   - Windows Firewall must be ON and "dangerous" ports must not be in the exceptions
   - Automatic Updates must be set to "download and install updates automatically"
   - Virus Protection must have a virus software program installed, automated, and
     registered with eTrust.
   This is just a Microsoft design decision and running a computer with any of the shield 
   colors set to yellow or red does not necessarily indicate a problem.

      1. Windows Firewall
      -------------------
      When installing the OSR software on the Windows XP Professional operating system, the 
      firewall must allow access to any TCP ports needed by remote OSR computers connecting
      to the firewalled computer, including additional ports needed by your platform.

      The default green shield settings for Windows Firewall will block license 
      enforcement operations for any license client connections from a remote computer,
      and will block client/server operations if the client and server are on different
      computers.  Therefore, changes to the Windows Firewall are required.

      o If the computer will act as an OSR License Server and serve remote OSR license
        connections: the TCP port(s) required by the OSR license client must be opened on
        the OSR License Server
      o If the computer will act an OSR Server in the OSR/Client Server configuration:
        the TCP ports required by the OSR Client must be opened on the OSR Server.

      The general procedure to access the Firewall is:

      o	From the Start Menu or Control Panel, choose Security Center
      o	Highlight Windows Firewall with the mouse.
      o Choices:
	- Disabling: If the machine will not be connected to the internet, or an easier 
          installation is desired, disable Windows Firewall.  The shield icon will turn red.
          Disabling the entire Windows Firewall is a potential security risk.  Do this only 
          if the machine will not be connected directly to the public internet, or if you 
          already have a site-wide firewall, or if you require the most simple installation.
        - Open the ports: click the Add Port dialog in the Exceptions tab in Windows
          Firewall to add the proper ports for client/server operations and licensing 
          operations to the list.  See the OSR Licensing Handbook and Client/Server Operations 
          guide for the list of ports to use.  If finer grain control is required, the
          Advanced tab in Windows Firewall (Network Connection Settings dialog) will allow 
          for greater fine-tuning.  Depending on your settings, the shield color for Windows
          Firewall may turn yellow.
        - Allow the executables freedom: you can add the OSRServer.exe program to the 
          exceptions list in the Exceptions tab if you are running Client/Server; you can
          add the lmgrd.exe and swilmgrd.exe programs to enable remote license server connections
          if the firewalled computer is running a license server. Depending on your settings,
          the shield color for Windows Firewall may turn yellow.
        - Reactionary: When a remote computer attemps a network connection to a firewalled
          computer, a Windows Security Alert dialog box opens.  Click Unblock in this dialog
          to allow the connection.  NOTE: this "reactionary" method requires supervision for 
          the first of each kind of connection, and may cause all calls to fail until the
          ports are unblocked!  Depending on your settings, the shield color for Windows
          Firewall may turn yellow.

      2. Automatic Updates
      --------------------
      Disabling automatic updates or taking manual control of the updates will turn the 
      shields color from green to yellow (manual control) or red (disabled).  This will 
      not affect OSR operations.

      3. Virus Protection
      -------------------
      ScanSoft typically recommends that virus software not run alongside an OSR server 
      for optimal performance reasons.  If the computer is not connected to the Internet, 
      this does not introduce risk.  Even if the computer is connected to the Internet, but is 
      not used for web browsing or reading e-mail and downloading files, there is lesser risk.

      If no anti-virus software is registered with Windows, the shield will turn red.  This will 
      not affect OSR operations and actually reflects the ideal situation for a standalone 
      OSR server.  If the anti-virus software is out-of-date with eTrust, the shield will 
      turn yellow.  This will not affect OSR operations.

  Please refer to the Microsoft documentation shipping with Windows XP Service Pack 2 for
  authoritative instructions on how to access Security Center features.  Also, keep in mind
  that while ScanSoft has experienced no problems with modifying the settings or changing
  the shield colors in Windows Security Center, having any shield color in a non-optimal
  (non-green) state is considered to be a SECURITY RISK by Microsoft.


B. Linux and Solaris
====================

- Open the SpeechWorks.cfg text configuration file for editing.  This
  file is located in your installation directory.

  ** Alternatively, you can use environment variables.  Environment variables
     will override settings in SpeechWorks.cfg!!!!

- Set and modify the following values:

  SWIlicenseServerList:
	  Replace "27000@localhost" with the actual location of your license
	  server.  If it's to run on your install machine, no change is
	  needed, unless you wish to add other servers.  See the "OSR 3.0
          Licensing Handbook" for instructions on how to change this, or add
          more servers.

- Modify your environment as follows:

     Add SWISRSDK to your environment.  SWISRSDK should point to your
     chosen OSR installation directory.  For example (assuming csh or
     tcsh):

       For OSR and OSR Server:
         setenv SWISRSDK /usr/local/SpeechWorks/OpenSpeech_Recognizer

       For OSR Client:
         setenv SWISRSDK \
            /usr/local/SpeechWorks/OpenSpeech_Recognizer_Client

     For Red Hat Enterprise Server 3.0 to avoid bugs in the default pthread library, 
     you must add the following path to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH for both client and server installations:
     (SPR #10376, 10358)
     
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /lib/i686:$SWISRSDK/lib


     For other Red Hat versions of Linux and for Solaris installations, use the following path:

     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $SWISRSDK/lib



     Add $SWISRSK/bin to your PATH.  This will allow you to run the
     OSR 2.0 programs without having to specify the full path to the
     bin directory.  For example (assuming csh or tcsh):

        setenv PATH "$SWISRSDK/bin:$PATH"

   - If you installed the OSR Client software on this machine, you
     must configure the available OSR Servers in the file
     $SWISRSDK/config/SWIsvrConfig.xml file.  Please consult the OSR
     Client-Server Operator's Guide.

   - If you installed the OSR Server software, you must run both the
     SWIsvcMonitor and the OSRServer.  Start the SWIsvcMonitor as a
     system daemon, then execute "swisvc -start" from the command
     line.  You should be able to observe threads from both
     "OSRServer" and "SWIsvcMonitor" processes using "ps -Af".
