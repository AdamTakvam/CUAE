This sample illustrates use of ElSSHClient and supplementary classes 
(TElShellSSHTunnel and TElSSHTunnelConnection) with .NET Framework sockets for 
tunneling remote-initiated connection to local host via SSH tunnel. 

Only password-based authentication is supported. Keyboard-interactive and 
key-based authentication are not implemented.
