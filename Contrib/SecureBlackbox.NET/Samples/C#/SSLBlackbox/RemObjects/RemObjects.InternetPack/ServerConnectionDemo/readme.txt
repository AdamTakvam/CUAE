This is a server side of the secure chat sample. The sample uses ROInternetPack 
classes for networking and SSLServerConnection (created via 
SSLServerConnectionFactory) component for SSL support.   

Note, that the sample does not expose certificate management (so Diffie-Hellman
Anonymous cipher suite is used).
