This sample illustrates use of TElSFTPClient and supplementary classes 
(TElSSHClient, TElShellSSHTunnel and TElSSHTunnelConnection) with .NET 
Framework sockets. Sockets are used in asynchronous mode. 

Note, that you can also use TElSimpleSFTPClient, which doesn't require use of 
supplementary classes.
