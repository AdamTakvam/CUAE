			<p class="TopicText">Welcome to SecureBlackbox. You have just installed .NET component library.
			<br>Usually the files are integrated into Visual Studio, Borland C#Builder and Borland Delphi for .NET automatically. If you need to add the components to Toolbox manually, do the following:

				In <b>Visual Studio 2005</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Use Main Menu -> Tools -> Choose Toolbox items to open Toolbox Customization dialog
					<li>In the dialog that appears activate .NET Framework Components tab
					<li>Use a filter to show only those components, which contain "SecureBlackbox" in the assembly name. To do this put "SecureBlackbox" to the filter box.
					<li>Check all components that appear.
					<li>If you don't find some component in the list, use Browse button to find and add the assembly, which contains the component, to the list

			<p class="TopicText" align="justify">
			SecureBlackbox components require a key, without which they can't be used. For evaluation purposes you will find a trial key in the folder where you installed SecureBlackbox.
			The key is named "LicenseKey.der". To pass the license key to components, you need to call SetLicenseKey function which is located in SecureBlackbox assembly.
			All sample projects include this call.
			<p class="TopicText" align="justify">
			You will find demo projects for C# and VB.NET in &lt;SecureBlackbox&gt;\Samples subfolder.

				SSLBlackbox includes not only SSL classes themselves, but also components that can be used with third-party libraries. Currently RemObjects SDK for .NET and RemObjects InternetPack are supported. These components are not installed by default. You will need to build and install the packages as described below.
			</p>
			<p class="TopicText">
				<ul>
					<li><span class="mainBold"><a name="adddelphi"></a>RemObjects products:</span><br>
						You need to install the SSLConnection project located in &lt;SecureBlackbox&gt;\Classes\RemObjects.InternetPack folder. <br />
						Note that you need to have RemObjects.InternetPack <i>1.0.1.49</i> and later to use SecureBlackbox.NET.

				To deploy SecureBlackbox with your project, use your regular installer tool. DO NOT USE SecureBlackbox installation package (which you downloaded and installed for development) for deployment purposes.
				<br>
				When deploying the project, copy the above described assemblies to your application folder.
				Questions about when and how to install the assemblies to Global Assembly Cache are discussed in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconWorkingWithAssembliesGlobalAssemblyCache.asp">Working with Assemblies and the Global Assembly Cache</a> and

<p class="TopicText">
SecureBlackbox includes support for IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm), which is protected under a patent registered in the USA, Europe and Japan.
<a href="http://www.mediacrypt.com/">MediaCrypt AG</a> holds all the relevant rights related to the distribution of the IDEA algorithm. Ascom, Switzerland holds the patents.
</p>
<p class="TopicText">
You choose whether to use IDEA or not. SecureBlackbox provides a way to turn off IDEA support completely. Alternatively, you can aquire licenses from MediaCrypt AG.
<br>
IDEA is used in SSL / TLS, SSH and PGP algorithms and protocols. While in SSL / TLS and SSH protocols IDEA support can be turned off with no effect, with PGP the situation is more complicated.
IDEA was used as a main encryption algorithm for storing PGP keys in PGP 2.x.. So if you don't use PGP, or you don't need to support PGP 2.x keys, you can safely disable IDEA in SecureBlackbox.
</p>
<p class="TopicText">
To disable IDEA support in .NET edition, set global variable SBIDEA.Unit.IdeaSupported to false.
<br>
To disable IDEA support in VCL edition, set global variable SBIDEA.IdeaSupported to false.
