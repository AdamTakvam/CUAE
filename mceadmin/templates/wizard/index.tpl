<p>
Welcome the Cisco Unified Application Environment Management Console!  Because this is your first time running the console,
you will need to set up the initial configuration for the environment on this box.  You may do
this in two ways:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<strong><a href="wizard_step1.php">Run the Install Wizard</a></strong>
	<p>
	This easy guided process will help you set the basic configuration needed to
	get the Cisco UAE server up and running.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong><a href="restore.php">Perform A System Restore</a></strong>
	<p>
	If you have a system backup from another Cisco UAE server, you may use that to
	restore that state to this server.
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
