Here's how it works.
Phone A - one line, can call phone B
Phone B - one line, shared with a SCCP device on the CUAE

Phone C - test phone that can dial the CUAE


1. Install app
2. edit application settings, and set the SharedLineDN to the number of phone B's shared line
3. edit triggering criteria so that you can dial into the app

4. Use phone A to call B, or other way around
5. using phone C, dial into the application

You should now hear what's going on.

To make this relationship bi-directional, you may need to edit the app.
