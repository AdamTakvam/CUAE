information we have available:
device name - sid
callReference - constant through the duration of the call on the same line.

messages we care about:
CallInfoMessage - CCM->Client; CallingParty, CallingPartyName, CalledParty, Call Identifier, LastRedirectingParty, CallType, LastRedirectingReason, Line Instance
CallStateMessage - CCM->Client; Call Identifier, CallState, LineInstance
OpenReceiveChannel - CCM->Client; CallReference/ConferenceId, 'PassThruPartyID'
OpenReceiveChannelAck - Client->CCM; IP Address, Port, 'PassThruPartyID'
StartMediaTransmission - CCM->Client; ConferenceID, 'PassThruPartyID', Remote IP, remote Port
StopMediaTransmission - CCM->Client; conferenceId, 'PassThruPartyID'



We call the state machine function, passing in call identifier and line instance, that way the FSM function can retrieve and operate
on the correct set of data.


we must first look at line instance, then we must look at callrefid
have some sort of parameter that will tell us whether we can or can't accept barges in that particular session.
