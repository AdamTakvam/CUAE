  <!-- In the case this is a guest user, it may be necessary that we need to provide a device profile...
       it might make sense to make every 'pool user' have one default 'pool device profile' associated with
       their accounts.  More close investigation into the requirements of the project, and the information
       present in the reservation system will help decide how this must behave -->
