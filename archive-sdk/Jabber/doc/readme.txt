To show the SDK,

You will first need a registered username/password for your bot user in your Jabber Server.
You will also need a chat room created.

you will need to first install the provider, which has configs which must be set after installation--if all the configs are correct, 
the bot user will log into the chat room and can then begin sending and receiving messages.
