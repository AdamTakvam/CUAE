For the purposes of the licensing (GPL), I consider 'source' to be any
ASCII line-based, delimited or fixed-width-column format.  CSV files,
like those distributed here, are one example of such a format.

In other words:

1) You may use this data as you wish.

2) You may redistribute this data as-is.

3) You may redistribute this data in an alternative ASCII format as
described above.

4) You may redistributed this data in a binary or proprietary format
as long as you provide ASCII text versions of the data as well (the
'source').

5) Derivative works, if distributed, must be distributed under the
same license.

I would also request that derivative works (updated and expanded versions
of this collection) periodically be submitted back to myself for inclusion
in the online database, to benefit everyone.  This is not a licensing
requirement, it's just a nice thing to do...
