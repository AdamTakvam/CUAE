How To Install the application on the CUAS
------------------------------------------

**MediaServer must run co-located with Application Server

1. Place these media files on the CUAS:
contrib\rt_sales_demo_080106_p2.png must reside in c:\images
contrib\rt_sales_demo_080106.png must reside in c:\images
contrib\green_icon.png must reside in c:\images
contrib\red_icon.png must reside in c:\images

contrib\rt__sku_080106.png must reside in c:\program files\metreos\mceadmin\public\

Copy RetailStoreFront\sql to CUAS.  Then must run initialize_db.bat on Application Server (be sure to put init.sql in same directory as bat file... doesn't matter which directory)


2. Create IP Phone Service in CCM:
Service URL (replace CUAE_IP with the ip of the app server):
http://CUAE_IP:8000/Retail/Start?device=#DEVICENAME#

3. Find IP Phone device and subscribe to the IP Phone Service

4. Associate metreos/metreos user with IP phone to test.

5. Check configs on mceadmin > Application > RetailStoreFront.  There should be a database username/password that might have to be updated to reflect your own setup.

------------------
On the IP Phone, click the services button and then launch the service. 

Click on Update Status button in the top right of app window.
This will show a list of 'users' 

click on a user. Sign in with 
UserID: 111111

now that there is a user signed in, click on Inventory Helpdesk to call them.

To look at a product sku, click on Inventory Availability
