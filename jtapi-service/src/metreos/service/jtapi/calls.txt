A call is incoming on a monitored line:

(two cases for the device making the call or receiving
the call. CTI is a cti terminal (cti port, route point),
EQUIP is some physical device like a computer or a
phone)
 
 -> IncomingCall
 <- AcceptCall (CTI) or SetCallId (EQUIP)
 -> RingingCall
 <- [AnswerCall]
 -> EstablishedCall
 -> [TalkingCall] (CTI)
 
 A call is outgoing on a monitored line:
 
 <- [MakeCall]
 -> MadeCall (~MakeCall) or EstablishedCall (MakeCall)
 -> [TalkingCall] (CTI)
