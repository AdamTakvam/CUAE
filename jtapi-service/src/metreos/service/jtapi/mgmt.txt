Here is the initialization / management sequence:

Register (client -> jtapiservice)
	ctiManagerIp+
	username
	password
	deviceType
	deviceName+

Unregister (client -> jtapiservice)
	deviceType
	deviceName+

Status (jtapiservice -> client)
	status
	deviceType
	deviceName+
	reason

RegisterMediaCaps (client -> jtapiservice)
	codec
	framesize+

UnregisterMediaCaps (client -> jtapiservice)
	codec

Notes:

	ctiManagerIp+ means one or more cti manager ip. the
	first is considered primary, the others secondary.
	
	type is ctiPort (2) or routePoint (3).
	
	deviceName+ means one or more device names.
	
	type/deviceName is unique. a device name by itself is not
	unique.
	
	multiple online / offline messages may be sent regarding
	the same cti manager / username / password / deviceType.
	They are all treated as one (temporal issues aside).
	
	when a cti manager itself goes online or offline, it will
	be reported as all the affected devices going online or
	offline.
	
	when devices are reported online or offline, only the
	devices listed are affected.

Issues:

	will there only be one username / password pair associated
	with a given ctiManagerIp? that is, does every mention of a
	given ctiManagerIp specify the same username and password?
	[ the answer is no. different devices may require different
	credentials to gain access at a given call manager. ]
	
	is framesize of a codec required? [ the answer is yes. ]
